## [IWHBYD](https://iwhbyd-558e77ba8bb6.herokuapp.com/)

###_IWHBYD_** is Full Stack React Web Application that utilizes Node.js, Express.js, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to "Finish the Fight". Stand shoulder to should along side Master Chief and the other brave spartans of UNSC from the Halo Universe. Users will be able to pick specific characteristics for themselves or to create a new character and generate an image of their Spartan. Prove that soldiers and humanity aren't two different things, that soldiers aren't machines. Do you need a weapon...?

## ü§ñ The Code to Call the OpenAI

</div>

```js
// Part of the controller function to call and retrive the data from OpenAI API
const data = JSON.stringify({
      prompt: prompt,
    });

    // Configure the Axios request
    const config = {
      method: "post",
      maxBodyLength: Infinity,
      url: "https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        // Add any additional headers if needed
      },
      data: data,
    };
```

<div align="center">

#### This code is part of a much larger function that makes the call to the OpenAI image generator by making an Axios request. The request is set a configure variable with a "POST" method, a maximum body length of infinity for the prompt, the url endpoint, a header that is authorized by having an OpenAI API key, storing having data that is set to a url.

## Plans for the future:

I love the Halo lore, and it was my hope to share this with people that are familiar or might be new to it. This project was by far the toughest one that I have worked on, and I learned so much from it. React is an awesome framework and I look forward to building more projects in a MERN stack development. I will continue evolving this application to have more features and be able to develop more detailed phots. I also will provide more information in the application of the Halo Universe that influenced this project.
